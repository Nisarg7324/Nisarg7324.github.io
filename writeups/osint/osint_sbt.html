        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The only known information regarding the suspect is their Twitter/X handle, which is <strong id="answer">@sp1ritfyre</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Search the username</h3>
            <p>Since we only know the Twitter/X handle of of the suspect, we will start from there. So let's look up for this account. We can simply search this username on Google. I got some results out of which two caught my attention which are mentioned in the images below.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/google_search_handle_p1.png">
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/google_search_handle_p2.png">
            <p>We found 2 profiles by the username <strong>sp1ritfyre</strong>: on Twitter/X and Blogger. We will start with the Twitter/X account.</p>
            <h3>Investigating Twitter/X Account</h3>
            <p>Let's view the Twitter/X account of the target. The images below shows content from the target's Twitter/X account.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/twitter.png">
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/twitter_post.png">
            <p>There is a website link mentioned in the user info: <strong id="answer">cmVkaHVudC5uZXQK.xyz</strong>. This looks like a Base64 encoded string. Thus, I used an online tool to decode this string. The tool I used is at <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">https://www.base64decode.org/</a>. The following image shows that it is indeed a Base64 encoded string.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/original_link.png">
            <p>Hence, we got one of the requested info: A website owned by the target which is <strong id="answer">redhunt.net</strong>. So, I visited the website and it had the same red bulb image as the Twitter/X post. I do not know what the red bulb image indicates, but it may indicate that the Twitter/X account and this website are handled by the same user. The image of the website home page is as shown below.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/redhunt_homepage.png">
            <p>I did not find much from the website. Hence, I moved on to our second lead: the Blogger page.</p>
            <h3>Investigating Blogger Account</h3>
            <p>I visited <strong>Sp1ritFyre's</strong> Blogger account page and we get some more information about <strong>Sp1ritFyre</strong> as shown in the image below.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/sam_wood_profile.png">
            <p>The first thing I observed is the same red bulb image. This image feels like a trademark that shows that this content or website is handled by <strong>Sp1ritFyre</strong>.</p>
            <p>I see that there is a hyperlink at <strong id="answer">Hacker Stories</strong>. Once I clicked on the link, I got redirected to <a href="https://sp1ritfyrehackerstories.blogspot.com/"><strong id="answer">https://sp1ritfyrehackerstories.blogspot.com/</strong></a> as shown in the image below.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/hacker_stories_blog.png">
            <p>However, there is not any new information here, but this is a blog website handled by _Sp1ritFyre_ which is part of a requested info.</p>
            <p>Next, we get to learn that <strong>Sp1ritFyre</strong> is a female. She joined Blogger in March 2020. We also get a "Location" that looks like a Hex string: <strong id="answer">68747470733a2f2f73616d6d6965776f6f647365632e626c6f6773706f742e636f6d</strong>. I used <a href="https://cyberchef.org/">CyberChef</a> to decode this string, as it automatically detects the type of encoding and gives the decoded string, as shown in the image below.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/cyberchef_decode.png">
            <p>Hence, we have now received another blog website: <strong id="answer">https://sammiewoodsec.blogspot.com</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Investigating Blogspot Thread</h3>
            <p>I visited <a href="https://sammiewoodsec.blogspot.com">https://sammiewoodsec.blogspot.com</a> and the image below shows the landing page.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/blog_page.png">
            <p>We get a bunch of information from this website. From the little section on the right, we can see that the user's first name is <strong id="answer">Sam</strong> and the last name is <strong id="answer">Woods</strong>. Hence, our target's name is <strong id="answer">Sam Woods</strong> who also goes by the username <strong id="answer">sp1ritfyre</strong> on Twitter/X.</p>
            <p>Also, from the text that I have highlighted, we get the personal email address of Sam, which is <strong id="answer">d1ved33p@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
            <p>As I scrolled down, I found a blog where Sam discusses how she got into Cybersecurity which also provides additional information, as shown in the image below.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/about_sam.png">
            <p>We find out that Sam's age is <strong id="answer">23</strong>. She went to <strong id="answer">University of Plymouth</strong>, and started working at <strong id="answer">PhilmanSecurityInc.</strong> as <strong id="answer">Junior Pen Tester</strong> shortly after she graduated.</p>
            <p>Now, as we saw before, this website has an <strong>About Me</strong> section. We will move on to Sam's About Me section now to see if we can find any new information.</p>
            <h3>Sam Wood's Blogger Account</h3>
            <p>When clicked on visiting Sam's full profile, we get redericted to Sam's Blogger profile as shown in the image below.</p>
            <img class="solimage" src="../../images/osint_sbt/sam_wood_profile.png">
            <p>We find some new additional information from this page. Sam is located in <strong id="answer">Reading, United Kingdom</strong>. She is interested in <strong id="answer">Security, Programming, Technology, Gaming, Photography, and Camping</strong>. Her favorite movie is <strong id="answer">Ready Player One</strong> which came out in 2018. Her favorite music bands are <strong id="answer">The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Queen</strong>. Lastly, her favorite books are <strong id="answer">The Hunger Games</strong> series.</p>
            <p>Now, we have enough information on our target <strong>sp1ritfyre</strong> or <strong>Sam Woods</strong> to fill out all the requested information and answer the questions.</p>
            <h3>Answering the Challenge</h3>
            <p>Based on the collected information, we can now answer all the challenge questions.</p>
